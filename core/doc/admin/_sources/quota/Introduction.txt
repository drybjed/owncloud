Introduction
============

ownCloud allows the admin to specify a storage quota for users.
This quota is the maximum space a user is allowed to utilize for files located in their home storage.

The users quota is set in the Users page within ownCloud when creating a user.

Each user can have a different quota (shown above in the Storage column).
In addition, there is a default quota should a user not have a quota specified.

It is important to note that when setting a quota, the administrator needs to be aware that it applies only to the actual files and not the metadata.
This means when allocating a quota, the admin should make sure at least 10% more space is available for each user.
