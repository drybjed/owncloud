Obtaining the Client
====================

The latest version of the Client can be obtained on the ownCloud web site.

The ownCloud client for Windows is provided as a NSIS-based setup file for machine-wide installation.

Installing the ownCloud client on MAC OS follows the normal app bundle installation pattern:

#.  Download the installation file: Click
    ownCloud-x.y.z.dmg
    a window with the ownCloud icon opens.



#.  In that window, drag the ownCloud application into the
    Applications
    folder.



#.  On the right side of
    Applications
    , choose
    ownCloud



The ownCloud client is also provided in a convenient repository for a wide range of Linux distributions.
